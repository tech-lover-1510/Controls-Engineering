Control engineering is a field that focuses on designing systems to regulate behavior using control loops. It involves both open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) systems to achieve desired performance. Control engineers use sensors, controllers, and actuators to ensure systems operate efficiently and reliably. This discipline is essential in numerous applications, from industrial automation to aerospace engineering. This page mainly focuses on feedback control algorithms and their applications.
